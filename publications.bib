abstract = {Understanding the stakeholders of mobile money services and systems in developing countries remain critical issues that need to be addressed. Using the Stakeholder Theory, along with the Diffusion of Innovation Theory and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, this study gathered data from 110 respondents to contribute to the understanding of the mobile money (Orange Money) stakeholdersin Mali. The results characterized the stakeholders of the mobile money system and revealed that each stakeholder has its unique drivers and challenges towards the adoption of the mobile money system. These findings suggest that specific attention should be paid to each stakeholder by the mobile money operator in developing countries.},

abstract = {One of the current discussions is the resilience of health systems in developing countries. Online platforms users including health system users (patients, doctors) are worried about their privacy being violated. While the users of social media enjoy the opportunity to learn, connect, and share, their privacy on those platforms is at risk. A possible cause of this is the information privacy paradox, which describes a disconnect between users' stated concerns and actual behaviour. In the pilot phase of this study, the authors have used the partial least squares structural equation modelling technique for the analysis of the relationships postulated to explain self-disclosure in social network sites. The survey instrument's content validity and adapted model's constructs validity and reliability were confirmed, and the preliminary findings revealed that the derived model explains 32.9% of the user's self-disclosure intention on social network sites.},
